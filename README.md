# Portfolio
This is the beginning of my portfolio. I choose to use a template to get this page started. I was able to modify the template to do exactly what I wanted it to do. I think that this is a good example of what I have learned so far in this class. Even though I did not code this from scratch I was able to read and understand what was going on with this template. I am much happier with this portfolio than the first one that I created. 

I look forward to continuing to develop my portfolio as we go through this class. I need to work on updating my resume for this job.
