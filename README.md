# Portfolio
A responsive portfolio website with 3 separate pages. 

This was my attempt to follow the wire frame that was given to us for this project. 

This will be a project that I come back to as we learn more in the class to work on the quality of the responsiveness and update the code to reflect the new things that I have learned. This is a very basic site and the fuctionality is not all there yet. 

The contact page is just html and css with bootstrap. There is no actual fuctionality on the contact page. 

My portfolio page is also lacking at this point since I have not done very many projects, so this will be something else that can expand as we go further through the class.

This is a screen shot of the About Me page.
